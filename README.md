## Return of the Png
Program to batch convert .webp files to .png files without the need for 3rd party binaries/software.

Written in Python

Also works on converting single .webp files to .png files.

All file conversions are lossless.

#Note:

Currently doing batch conversions only works if the file extensions are "webp" (lowercase).
Extensions like "WEBP" or "wEBp" for example do not work.
This does however work in single file conversions.
