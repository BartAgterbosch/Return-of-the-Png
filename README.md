# Return of the Png
CLI program to batch convert .webp files to .png files without the need for 3rd party binaries/software.

Written in Python.

Also works on converting single .webp files to .png files.

All file conversions are lossless.

To batch convert a folder with webp files, enter the folder location, it will create a png folder inside that folder with the converted files.

To convert just a single file, enter the file's location, it will create a png file in the original file's same folder under the same name.

Folder and file locations MUST be the full locations, like "D:\Pictures\webpfolder" or "D:\Pictures\webpfolder\mypicture.webp"

#### Note:
Currently doing batch conversions only works if the file extensions are "webp" (lowercase).<br>
Extensions like "WEBP" or "wEBp" for example do not work.<br>
This does however work in single file conversions.
